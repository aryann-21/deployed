            Auto Rickshaws connect millions of people all over India. But the whole process is a time-consuming hassleâ€”finding a driver and haggling over prices. Our priority is to innovate on the existing system to make it far more efficient and effective.

            We understand the frustration of waiting for an auto and the uncertainty of negotiating fares. That's why we've created CampusCabs. Our app simplifies the process by connecting you with nearby auto rickshaws instantly. With just a few taps, you can book a ride, coordinate with others, and plan your trips in advance.
